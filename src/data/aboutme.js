  description:
    "I'm a Research Engineer at the <a href='https://avl.reef.ufl.edu/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory (REEF), University of Florida</a>, where I develop machine learning-based sensor calibration and fusion systems to enhance navigation in GPS-denied environments.<br /><br />My work bridges robotics, perception, and learning-based navigation with a focus on radar-only localization, multi-sensor fusion, and robust autonomous systems for both ground and aerial platforms.<br /><br />Previously, I contributed to research at the GAMMA Lab and Bio-Imaging & Machine Vision Lab at the University of Maryland, working on VR-based driving simulation, trajectory prediction, and computer vision for underwater systems.<br /><br />I am passionate about building reliable, data-driven autonomy by combining classical GNC principles with modern AI techniques.",
